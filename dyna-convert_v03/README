ABOUT:

dyna-convert.py is a small commandline utility that converts files downloaded from the ESM website to the most popular seismic formats.
It converts to all output formats supported by the ObsPy toolbox, such as miniseed, sac, etc.

dyna-convert.py conversion is kind of lazy, and very basic.
Only the following header fields are written in output files: 

- Sampling rate
- Delta
- Calibration factor
- Number of sample points
- Network code
- Location code
- Station code
- Channel code
- Date and time of the first data sample
- Date and time of the last data sample

if you need a more accurate conversion, you are free to hack dyna-convert.py to suit your needs.
